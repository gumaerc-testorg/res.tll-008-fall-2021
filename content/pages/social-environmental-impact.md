*Author:* In Song Kim 

*Lecture Module:* “Analyzing the Impact of Police Stopping in Political Behavior” 

*Keywords:* policing, stop-question-and-frisk, racial minorities, political behavior

*Module Goals:* This problem set explores how/whether policing against citizens and against racial minorities affects political behavior by leveraging a variety of data sources available online, including micro-level administrative data on policing.

*Authors:* Mikaela Springsteen, Madhurima Das, Swati Gupta

The activities which these cards contain are designed to subvert expectations and elicit conversation regarding the social and ethical responsibilities associated with design. They are organized into five categories: inputs, processes, outputs, feedback loops, and ecosystems, each of which focuses on a different part of the design or product lifecycle. 

These cards are intended to help foster in users a creative and flexible approach to the potential impacts of a design process, rather than treating any such outcomes or impacts as a formulaic "check-box" aspect of design. Indeed, flexibility is built into the very nature of the cards themselves—these cards can be used in a variety of settings, and while the cards may have specific time and material requirements listed, they can often be adapted and "remixed" to suit specific learning environments and contexts. 

## MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing
