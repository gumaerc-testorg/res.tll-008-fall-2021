*Author:* Dwai Banerjee

*Lecture Module:* "Big Data and Personal Privacy"

*Keywords:* privacy; AI; surveillance; data ethics

*Module Goals:*

- To find overlaps and differences in the experience of students learning about their right to privacy
- To discuss whether they believe existing rights to be adequate
- To examine whether current ethical standards (such as those instituted by the GDPR) sufficiently protect their rights (as they exist or as they believe should exist).

*Authors:* Erik Lin-Greenberg, Lily Tsai

*Lecture Module:* "Cyber Crisis Scenario"

*Keywords:* emerging technology and international security, the politics of cybersecurity, national security policy, the law of armed conflict/international law  

*Module Goals:* A scenario-based end-of-semester exercise for an MIT undergraduate political science course, implemented over two 80 min classes. The scenario was intended to provide students with an opportunity to apply core class concepts, which included an understanding of the interagency process, the various actors involved in making and implementing national security policy, the law of armed conflict/international law, and the changing character of international crises.
