[STS.012/STS.008 Science in Action: Technologies and Controversies in Everyday Life]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/privacy-surveillance/science-in-action-technologies-and-controversies-in-everyday-life)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Author:_ Dwai Banerjee

_Lecture Module:_ "Big Data and Personal Privacy"

_Keywords:_ privacy; AI; surveillance; data ethics

_Module Goals:_

*   To find overlaps and differences in the experience of students learning about their right to privacy
*   To discuss whether they believe existing rights to be adequate
*   To examine whether current ethical standards (such as those instituted by the GDPR) sufficiently protect their rights (as they exist or as they believe should exist).
