[STS.047 Quantifying People: A History of Social Science]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/privacy-surveillance/quantifying-people-a-history-of-social-science)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Author:_ Will Deringer

_Lecture Module:_ "Quantify and Punish: Data, Race, and Policing from the Burgess Method to Big Data"

_Keywords__:_ ​​policing; criminal justice; race; racism; actuarial techniques; risk assessments; big data; surveillance

_Questions addressed:_

*   What role have quantitative data, computational methods, and social science played in the construction of modern systems of criminal justice?
*   How has quantification contributed to the injustices of modern policing and punishment—to the creation and maintenance of a system that disproportionately and unjustly targets, punishes, incarcerates, and kills people of color, especially Black citizens?
*   What can history tell us about the role that data and computation should—or should not—play in efforts to create a more just system of justice in the future?

[STS.012/STS.008 Science in Action: Technologies and Controversies in Everyday Life]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/privacy-surveillance/science-in-action-technologies-and-controversies-in-everyday-life)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Author:_ Dwai Banerjee

_Lecture Module:_ "Big Data and Personal Privacy"

_Keywords:_ privacy; AI; surveillance; data ethics

_Module Goals:_

*   To find overlaps and differences in the experience of students learning about their right to privacy
*   To discuss whether they believe existing rights to be adequate
*   To examine whether current ethical standards (such as those instituted by the GDPR) sufficiently protect their rights (as they exist or as they believe should exist).

Active Learning Projects Developed at MIT
-----------------------------------------

### [Active Learning Project: Exploring the Functionalities, Data and Interfaces of a Modern Online Advertising System (PDF - 1.1MB)](/editor{{< baseurl >}}/resources/res-tll008f21-alp-elo_practice_lab) ([DOCX - 3.2MB](/editor{{< baseurl >}}/resources/res-tll008f21-alp-elo_practice_lab-1))

An exercise to explore the ethical implications of digital advertising, grounded in the functionalities, data, and interfaces driving ad systems in the modern era. This lab focuses on Facebook’s Ads Manager.
