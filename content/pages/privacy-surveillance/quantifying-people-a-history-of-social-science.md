_Author:_ Will Deringer

_Keywords:_ ​​policing; criminal justice; race; racism; actuarial techniques; risk assessments; big data; surveillance

_Questions addressed:_

*   What role have quantitative data, computational methods, and social science played in the construction of modern systems of criminal justice?
*   How has quantification contributed to the injustices of modern policing and punishment—to the creation and maintenance of a system that disproportionately and unjustly targets, punishes, incarcerates, and kills people of color, especially Black citizens?
*   What can history tell us about the role that data and computation should—or should not—play in efforts to create a more just system of justice in the future?
