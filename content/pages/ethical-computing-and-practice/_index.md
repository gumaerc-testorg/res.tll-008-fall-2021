Active Learning Projects Developed at MIT
-----------------------------------------

### [Active Learning Project: Exploring the Functionalities, Data and Interfaces of a Modern Online Advertising System (PDF - 1.1MB)](/editor{{< baseurl >}}/resources/res-tll008f21-alp-elo_practice_lab) ([DOCX - 3.2MB](/editor{{< baseurl >}}/resources/res-tll008f21-alp-elo_practice_lab-1))

An exercise to explore the ethical implications of digital advertising, grounded in the functionalities, data, and interfaces driving ad systems in the modern era. This lab focuses on Facebook’s Ads Manager.
