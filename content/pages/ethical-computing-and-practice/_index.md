*Authors:* Leslie Kaelbling, Serena Booth, Marion Boulicault, Dheekshita Kumar, Rodrigo Ochigame, Tess Smidt

This course introduces principles, algorithms, and applications of machine learning from the point of view of modeling and prediction; formulation of learning problems; representation, over-fitting, generalization; classification, regression, reinforcement-learning, sequence learning, clustering; classical and neural-network methods.

The course has weekly labs, in which students work in pairs and have an opportunity to discuss their work with an instructor during a check-off process. Each weekly lab has an accompanying SERC question and discussion prompt. These SERC questions aim to help the students connect the technical content of the class to the social consequences of seemingly-technical design decisions. 

*Weekly Labs:* 4 weekly labs, each with a SERC question and discussion prompt

*Keywords:* machine learning; bias and fairness in machine learning; data bias; model bias

*Author:* Rob Miller, Abby Jaques 

*Lecture Module:* “Moral Lenses Case Study” 

*Keywords:* Software Construction

*Module Goals:* A reading and class activity to explore the implications of a proposed change to change the ranking algorithm for posts on a social media site, and examine:

- What are the main benefits it will or may provide, and to whom?
- What are the main harms it will or may cause, and to whom?
- How could you maximize the benefits and minimize the harms, and ensure that they are distributed fairly?

*Authors:* Mikaela Springsteen, Madhurima Das, Swati Gupta

The activities which these cards contain are designed to subvert expectations and elicit conversation regarding the social and ethical responsibilities associated with design. They are organized into five categories: inputs, processes, outputs, feedback loops, and ecosystems, each of which focuses on a different part of the design or product lifecycle. 

These cards are intended to help foster in users a creative and flexible approach to the potential impacts of a design process, rather than treating any such outcomes or impacts as a formulaic "check-box" aspect of design. Indeed, flexibility is built into the very nature of the cards themselves—these cards can be used in a variety of settings, and while the cards may have specific time and material requirements listed, they can often be adapted and ‘remixed’ to suit specific learning environments and contexts.                                              

## MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing

Brief, specially commissioned and peer-reviewed cases intended to be effective for undergraduate instruction across a range of classes and fields of study. Some cases are paired with active learning projects developed by students at MIT and reviewed by faculty and senior researchers.
